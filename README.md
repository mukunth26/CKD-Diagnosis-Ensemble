# CKD-Diagnosis-Ensemble

# Project Description

Over 10% of the global population, or an enormous 800 million people, are affected by chronic kidney disease, which is a serious health problem. It entails a slow decline in kidney function, which clears wastes and extra fluid from the circulation.

The project focuses on performance improvement which is achieved by using three ensemble approaches namely Bagging,Random subspace,voting claasifier methods, to five base models: k Nearest Neighbour, Naive Bayes, and Decision tree,Support vector machine,Logistic Regression.
Accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, kappa, and ROC are the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models. The project's findings demonstrate that, in comparison to individual base learners, the ensemble approaches applied produce superior results. The ensemble model can help with accurate chronic kidney disease diagnosis.
